\begin{abstract}
This report covers the classification of individual finger movements using one sensor in real-time with an AI classifier using electromyography (EMG) signals. The BeagleBone Green microcontroller, Grove EMG detector, and nRF52840 Dongle were used to sample the surface EMG signals. A number of algorithms and classifier with available libraries was investigated. KNN achieved the best offline accuracy of over 80\%. The use of the temporal feature extraction multi-set, PCA with two principal components, and KNN was found to be the best performing classifier when running classification on live data, with an accuracy of 10.1\%. However real-time classification was not achieved on the microcontroller.



% An abstract should summarize the work in brief. Now follows some text that you can remove by writing the sign "\%" in front of the command "blindtext", you can always comment out text you have written using the "\%" command.
