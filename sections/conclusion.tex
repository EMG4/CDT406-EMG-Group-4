\section{Conclusion}
During this project, the aim was to develop a system that could perform real-time classification of individual finger movements with AI using EMG signals on a BeagleBone Green microcontroller. The developed system managed to classify when executing on the microcontroller but was not optimized to achieve real-time classification on the microcontroller due to its limited resources. 
The results show that KNN was the best-performing classifier, achieving a prediction accuracy of 82.6\% during offline training and 10.1\% for live data.
The findings of this project indicates that the aim of the project is possible to achieve but requires improvements and more optimization. Future work is also required to further the research to allow for real life applications.






%The second research question aimed to determine which set of features, the use of PCA or not, and which classifier yielded the highest accuracy when answering the first research question. The use of PCA for dimensionality reduction did not provide a consistent increase in classification performance. However, the best performance was achieved when five principal components were used.
