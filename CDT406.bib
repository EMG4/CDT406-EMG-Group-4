PyGAD supports a wide range of parameters to give the user control over everything in its life cycle. This includes, but is not limited to, population, gene value range, gene data type, parent selection, crossover, and mutation. PyGAD is designed as a general-purpose optimization library that allows the user to customize the fitness function. Its usage consists of 3 main steps: build the fitness function, create an instance of the pygad.GA class, and calling the pygad.GA.run() method. The library supports training deep learning models created either with PyGAD itself or with frameworks like Keras and PyTorch. Given its stable state, PyGAD is also in active development to respond to the user's requested features and enhancement received on GitHub https://github.com/ahmedfgad/GeneticAlgorithmPython. PyGAD comes with documentation https://pygad.readthedocs.io for further details and examples.},

  abstract = {Electromyogram (EMG) signals have been increasingly used for hand and finger gesture recognition. However, most studies have focused on the wrist and whole-hand gestures and not on individual finger (IF) gestures, which are considered more challenging. In this study, we develop EMG-based hand/finger gesture classifiers based on fixed electrode placement using machine learning methods. Ten healthy subjects performed ten hand/finger gestures, including seven IF gestures. EMG signals were measured from three channels, and six time-domain (TD) features were extracted from each channel. A total of 18 features was used to build personalized classifiers for ten gestures with an artificial neural network (ANN), a support vector machine (SVM), a random forest (RF), and a logistic regression (LR). The ANN, SVM, RF, and LR achieved mean accuracies of 0.940, 0.876, 0.831, and 0.539, respectively. One-way analyses of variance and F-tests showed that the ANN achieved the highest mean accuracy and the lowest inter-subject variance in the accuracy, respectively, suggesting that it was the least affected by individual variability in EMG signals. Using only TD features, we achieved a higher ratio of gestures to channels than other similar studies, suggesting that the proposed method can improve the system usability and reduce the computational burden.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               For high usability, myo-controlled devices require robust classification schemes during dynamic contractions. Therefore, this study investigates the impact of the training data set in the performance of several pattern recognition algorithms during dynamic contractions.                                         Methods               A 9 class experiment was designed involving both static and dynamic situations. The performance of various feature extraction methods and classifiers was evaluated in terms of classification accuracy.                                         Results               It is shown that, combined with a threshold to detect the onset of the contraction, current pattern recognition algorithms used on static conditions provide relatively high classification accuracy also on dynamic situations. Moreover, the performance of the pattern recognition algorithms tested significantly improved by optimizing the choice of the training set. Finally, the results also showed that rather simple approaches for classification of time domain features provide results comparable to more complex classification methods of wavelet features.                                         Conclusions               Non-stationary surface EMG signals recorded during dynamic contractions can be accurately classified for the control of multi-function prostheses.},

  abstract = {Electrical activity is generated in the forearm muscles during muscular contractions that control dexterous movements of a human finger and thumb. Using this electrical activity as an input to train a neural network for the purposes of classifying finger movements is not straightforward. Low cost wearable sensors i.e., a Myo Gesture control armband (www.bynorth.com), generally have a lower sampling rate when compared with medical grade EMG detection systems e.g., 200 Hz vs 2000 Hz. Using sensors such as the Myo coupled with the lower amplitude generated by individual finger movements makes it difficult to achieve high classification accuracy. Low sampling rate makes it challenging to distinguish between large quantities of subtle finger movements when using a single network. This research uses two networks which enables for the reduction in the number of movements in each network that are being classified; in turn improving the classification. This is achieved by developing and training LSTM networks that focus on the extension and flexion signals of the fingers and a separate network that is trained using thumb movement signal data. By following this method, this research have increased classification of the individual finger movements to between 90 and 100\%.},
